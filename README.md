My project is a very simple burger menu ordering system that allows the user to pick one of three burgers and add (or not) two sides. I used the Decorator, Factory, State and Iterator patterns. I attempted to use the command pattern and it can be seen in the code but I don't beleive I'm using it correclty.  The decorator pattern can be found in the "SideDecorator" file which extends the Burger class.  The Factory pattern can be found in the "BurgerFactory" file which creates one of three different burgers.  The State pattern can be found in all the files that begin with "State".  The Iterator pattern can be found in the "MenuIterator" file which iterates through the menu.  I implemented tests on many of the classes but only the BurgerFactoryTest, coleslawAddTest pass their tests.  The MenuIterator does not pass it's tests.  

I finished part of the GUI and it shows what has been ordered and the price. The GUI is certainly not finished and could use a lot of polishing.  I was unable to finish all the unit tests on the classes. I was unable to finalize the command pattern and would like to add more to the iterator and factory patterns.
